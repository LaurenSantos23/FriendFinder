# FriendFinder
## Overview 

 A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- similar to  a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a users'
 survey, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and  picture of the user with 
 the best overall match. This site utilizes html, javascript, jquery, node.js and express. 

Express is being utilized to handle routing. The site is deployed to Heroku, so users can submit their data and be compared with the Friends API that was created for this project.

The following NPM Packages are installed to run this app:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path)

Underneath the explanation is a button that leads the user to the survey page.  The user is then required to sumbit their name, a photo and answer 10 questions.  Upon clicking the submit button, the user is then shown a modal that gives their best match with a name and photo.
