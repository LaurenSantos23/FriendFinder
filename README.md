# FriendFinder
## Overview 

 A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- similar to  a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a users'
 survey, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and  picture of the user with 
 the best overall match.

Express is being utilized to handle routing. The site is deployed to Heroku, so users can submit their data and be compared with the Friends API that was created for this project.

The following NPM Packages are installed to run this app:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path)
